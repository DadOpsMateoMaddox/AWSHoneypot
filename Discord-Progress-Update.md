# 🍯 Tonight's Honeypot Progress Update - September 26, 2025

## 🚀 **Major Milestone: Cowrie Honeypot is LIVE and Operational!**

### 🕘 **Timeline of Tonight's Work:**

**8:00 PM - Initial Setup**
- Connected to EC2 instance (44.222.200.1)
- Attempted Cowrie installation but hit Python dependency issues
- Latest Cowrie master branch required setuptools>=80 (not available on Amazon Linux 2)

**8:30 PM - Troubleshooting Phase**
- Tried multiple Python versions (3.7, 3.8, 3.10)
- Attempted compiling Python 3.10 from source (failed due to SSL module issues)  
- Discovered version compatibility problems with modern dependencies

**9:15 PM - Solution Found**
- **BREAKTHROUGH**: Switched to Cowrie v2.5.0 (stable release)
- Removed conflicting pyproject.toml file
- Used traditional setup.py installation method
- Successfully installed all dependencies in Python 3.8 virtual environment

**9:45 PM - Cowrie Deployment**
- ✅ **Cowrie v2.5.0 successfully installed** in `/opt/cowrie/`
- ✅ **Honeypot running on port 2222** (confirmed with netstat)
- ✅ **Process active** (PID 19902, running as cowrie user)
- ✅ **Basic connectivity tested** - accepts SSH connections

**10:15 PM - Enhanced Honeypot Configuration**
- Created realistic fake filesystem structure
- Added believable fake sensitive files:
  - `passwords.txt` with fake credentials
  - `database.json` with fake API keys  
  - Realistic SSH private key (removed obvious fake indicators)
- Set proper file permissions to look authentic

**10:45 PM - Project Organization**
- Moved project to proper class directory structure
- Organized all files into logical folders:
  - 📚 Documentation and tutorials
  - 🚀 Deployment scripts  
  - ☁️ AWS infrastructure templates
  - 🔒 Security configurations
- Created comprehensive team access tutorials

**11:15 PM - Professional Documentation**
- Generated PlantUML architecture diagrams:
  - System architecture with AWS components
  - Attack sequence flow diagrams
  - Team deployment workflows
- Created beginner-friendly team tutorials for WSL/SSH setup

**11:45 PM - Repository Creation**
- ✅ **GitHub repository created**: https://github.com/DadOpsMateoMaddox/AWSHoneypot
- ✅ **All code and documentation pushed** (33 files committed)
- ✅ **Security maintained**: All SSH keys and credentials excluded
- ✅ **Professional README**: Emphasizes team collaboration and academic standards

---

## 🎯 **Current Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL**

### ✅ **What's Working Right Now:**
- **Cowrie SSH Honeypot**: Live on port 2222, accepting connections
- **Realistic Environment**: Fake filesystem with believable decoy files
- **Complete Logging**: All attacker activity captured and logged
- **Team Access**: SSH access configured for all team members
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive tutorials and setup guides ready

### 🔍 **Ready for Team Use:**
- **Connect via**: `ssh -p 2222 root@44.222.200.1` (to test honeypot)
- **Admin access**: Standard port 22 with team SSH keys
- **Monitoring**: Live logs at `/opt/cowrie/var/log/cowrie/cowrie.log`
- **All tutorials**: Available in GitHub repository

### 📊 **What We Can Monitor:**
- Real-time attacker interactions
- Complete command history and session recordings
- File access attempts and download behavior
- Attack patterns and threat intelligence
- Network connection analysis

## 👥 **Next Steps for Team:**

1. **📖 Review Documentation**: Check out the GitHub repo and tutorials
2. **🔑 Get SSH Access**: Contact me for team SSH keys  
3. **🖥️ Setup WSL**: Follow the beginner tutorial for Windows/WSL setup
4. **👀 Start Monitoring**: Begin observing honeypot activity
5. **📋 Coordinate**: Establish monitoring rotation schedule
