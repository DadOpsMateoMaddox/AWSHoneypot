# üîß EC2 Static IP Issue ‚Äî What Happened & How We Fixed It

## What Happened
Our honeypot EC2 instance public IP changed from **44.222.200.1** to **18.223.22.36**, which broke everyone's SSH connections and bookmarks.

---

## Why This Happened
EC2 instances get **dynamic public IPs** by default. AWS will assign a new public IP when any of the following occur:

- You *stop and start* the instance (not just reboot).  
- The instance crashes and AWS restarts it.  
- AWS performs certain maintenance events.

In these cases AWS assigns a *new random public IP* from their pool.

---

## Why My Previous "Static IP" Fix Failed
Here are the likely causes for the earlier problem:

- I may have just noted the current IP and assumed it was permanent.  
- I allocated an Elastic IP but never **associated** it with the instance.  
- I associated it temporarily but it got disconnected during a stop/start.  
- I mixed up *dynamic* vs *static* IP concepts.

> **Key lesson:** just because an IP doesn‚Äôt change for days/weeks doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs *static*.

---

## ‚úÖ What We Did Differently This Time

**Step 1 ‚Äî Allocated a TRUE Elastic IP**

Allocated: **44.218.220.47** (this is now *ours* permanently while attached)

**Step 2 ‚Äî Properly Associated It**

Command used:

```bash
aws ec2 associate-address --instance-id i-04d996c187504b547 --public-ip 44.218.220.47
```

*(You can also associate by `--allocation-id` if you used `allocate-address --domain vpc`.)*

**Step 3 ‚Äî Verified the Association**

- Confirmed EC2 console shows **Elastic IP** attached to `i-04d996c187504b547`.  
- Confirmed SSH works with **44.218.220.47**.  
- Verified the IP survives stop/start cycles.

### Understanding AWS IP Types

**Dynamic Public IP (Default):**

- ‚ùå Changes when instance stops/starts  
- ‚ùå Free but unreliable for persistent services  
- ‚ùå Can't be moved between instances

**Elastic IP (Static):**

- ‚úÖ Stays the same until you release it  
- ‚úÖ Can be moved between instances  
- ‚úÖ Free while attached to a running instance  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Costs apply (~$3.65/month) if allocated but *not attached*

## How to Check Your Current Setup

**Method 1 ‚Äî AWS Console**  
EC2 Dashboard ‚Üí Instances ‚Üí Select your instance ‚Üí Look at **Public IPv4 address**

**Method 2 ‚Äî CloudShell / CLI**

Get current public IP:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids YOUR_INSTANCE_ID --query 'Reservations[0].Instances[0].PublicIpAddress' --output text
```

Check whether an IP is an Elastic IP:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-addresses --public-ips YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
```

**Method 3 ‚Äî From Inside the Instance**

```bash
curl http://checkip.amazonaws.com/
```

## How to Assign a Static IP (Elastic IP) ‚Äî Step by Step

### Option A ‚Äî AWS Console (GUI)
1. EC2 Console ‚Üí **Elastic IPs** ‚Üí Allocate Elastic IP address  
2. Keep defaults ‚Üí Allocate  
3. Select new IP ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí **Associate Elastic IP address**  
4. Choose your instance ‚Üí Associate

### Option B ‚Äî CloudShell / CLI (recommended)
1. Allocate new Elastic IP (VPC):

```bash
aws ec2 allocate-address --domain vpc
```

Note the returned `AllocationId` (example: `eipalloc-xxxxxx`).

2. Associate with your instance:

```bash
aws ec2 associate-address --instance-id YOUR_INSTANCE_ID --allocation-id eipalloc-xxxxx
```

### Option C ‚Äî One-liner (if you already have the Elastic IP)

```bash
aws ec2 associate-address --instance-id YOUR_INSTANCE_ID --public-ip YOUR_ELASTIC_IP
```

---

## How to Verify It Worked

```bash
aws ec2 describe-addresses --public-ips YOUR_ELASTIC_IP
```

The output should show **AssociationId** and your **InstanceId**.

---

## Testing Static IP Persistence (Recommended)

1. Note current IP  
2. Stop the instance:

```bash
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids YOUR_INSTANCE_ID
```

3. Wait for stopped state  
4. Start the instance:

```bash
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids YOUR_INSTANCE_ID
```

5. Check IP again ‚Äî it should be the *same*.

## üîÑ Updated Connection Info

**New Static IP:** **44.218.220.47**

**SSH Command:**

```bash
ssh -i gmu-honeypot-key.pem ec2-user@44.218.220.47
```

_Note: if your AMI is Ubuntu you may need `ec2-user@44.218.220.47` as the user._

**Web Access:**

```
http://44.218.220.47
```

**Termius Settings:**
- Host: **44.218.220.47**  
- User: **ec2-user** (or *ubuntu*)  
- Port: **22**  
- Key: *gmu-honeypot-key.pem*

---

## üí° Key Takeaways
- Always use *Elastic IPs* for production services that require a stable public address.  
- **Allocate ‚â† Associate** ‚Äî you must do both.  
- Verify your setup by testing stop/start cycles.  
- CloudShell / CLI is faster for repetitive ops; GUI is fine for one-offs.  
- Dynamic IPs are fine for temporary/dev usage.

This IP will now remain **44.218.220.47** until we release the Elastic IP ‚Äî so bookmarks and scripts will be stable. üéØ

If you want, I can add a short runbook to the repo or update docs that reference the old IP.
