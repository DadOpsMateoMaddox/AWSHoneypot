# PlantUML Diagram Corrections and Enhancements

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Task**: Fix errors in honeypot-architecture.puml and generate accompanying sequence diagram

## Issues Fixed

### 1. honeypot-architecture.puml - Encoding Issue
**Problem**: Corrupted Unicode arrow characters in line 117
- The text contained malformed characters: `M-bM-^FM-^R` 
- This was a corrupted encoding of the → (right arrow) Unicode character
- Could cause rendering issues or display problems in some PlantUML viewers

**Solution**: 
- Replaced corrupted Unicode arrows with standard ASCII arrows (`->`)
- Changed from: `Filter → Enrich → Notify`
- Changed to: `Filter -> Enrich -> Notify`

**Location**: Line 117 in the Discord note section

**Result**: Diagram now validates successfully with PlantUML syntax checker

## New Diagram Created

### 2. operational-sequence.puml - Complete System Lifecycle
**Purpose**: Comprehensive sequence diagram showing end-to-end operational flow

**Features**:
- **System Initialization**: Deployment and configuration of Cowrie honeypot
- **Attack Detection**: Initial connection and reconnaissance phase
- **Authentication Phase**: Credential testing and fake acceptance
- **Session Interaction**: Command execution and fake filesystem responses
- **Malicious Activity**: File downloads and malware execution attempts
- **Threat Intelligence**: GreyNoise API integration for IP reputation
- **Real-time Alerting**: Discord webhook notification pipeline
- **Monitoring and Analysis**: Team access via SSH and AWS SSM
- **Session Termination**: Clean shutdown and summary reporting
- **Post-Attack Forensics**: Log analysis and evidence extraction
- **Continuous Operation**: 24/7 monitoring and threat intelligence gathering

**Components Included**:
- 17 participants representing the complete system architecture
- 11 distinct operational phases with detailed interactions
- Multiple notes explaining key concepts and workflows
- Consistent styling matching AWS color scheme
- Complete traceability from attack to response

## Validation

Both diagrams have been validated:
- ✅ `honeypot-architecture.puml` - Syntax validation passed
- ✅ `operational-sequence.puml` - Syntax validation passed
- ✅ Test renders generated successfully (PNG format)
- ✅ All PlantUML best practices followed

## Documentation Updates

### PlantUML-README.md
Added documentation for the new operational-sequence.puml diagram:
- Description of diagram purpose and features
- Integration into generation commands
- Proper sequencing with other diagrams

## File Summary

### Modified Files
1. `01-Project-Documentation/honeypot-architecture.puml` - Fixed encoding issue
2. `01-Project-Documentation/PlantUML-README.md` - Added new diagram documentation

### New Files
1. `01-Project-Documentation/operational-sequence.puml` - Complete operational flow diagram

## How to Use

### View Online
1. Visit http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/
2. Copy contents of `.puml` file
3. Paste and render

### Generate Locally
```bash
cd 01-Project-Documentation/

# Generate all diagrams
plantuml honeypot-architecture.puml
plantuml operational-sequence.puml

# Or generate all at once
plantuml *.puml
```

### Integrate in Documentation
The diagrams can be embedded in:
- Project presentations
- README.md files (as image links)
- Academic reports
- Security briefings
- Team training materials

## Technical Details

### Styling Approach
Both diagrams use consistent styling:
- AWS orange accent color (#FF9900)
- AWS dark blue borders (#232F3E)
- Clean white backgrounds
- Professional appearance suitable for academic and professional presentations

### Compatibility
- PlantUML 1.2020.02 or newer recommended
- Online PlantUML server compatible
- VS Code PlantUML extension compatible
- Export formats: PNG, SVG, PDF

## Conclusion

All requested tasks completed:
1. ✅ Reviewed honeypot-architecture.puml for errors
2. ✅ Fixed corrupted Unicode arrow characters
3. ✅ Created comprehensive operational-sequence.puml diagram
4. ✅ Validated all diagrams syntax
5. ✅ Updated documentation
6. ✅ Generated test renders

The diagrams now provide complete visual documentation of the AWS Honeypot system from both architectural and operational perspectives.
