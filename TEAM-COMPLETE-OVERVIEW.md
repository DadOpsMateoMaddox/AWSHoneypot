## 🔒 Security & Privacy Considerations

### Data Protection Measures
- **Session Recording:** Encrypted and stored in CloudWatch with 90-day retention
- **IP Logging:** Anonymized after 30 days (except for repeating attackers)
- **Credential Capture:** Fake credentials only, no actual secrets stored
- **Team Access:** Role-based access control (Discord channel permissions)

### Attacker Intelligence
- **No Harmful Response:** All troll responses are non-harmful, educational, or humorous
- **No Counter-Attack:** Honeypot does NOT attack or probe the attacker
- **Legal Compliance:** Honeypot is fully authorized AWS research project
- **Ethical Engagement:** Troll personas are designed to confuse, not harm

## ❓ FAQ & Common Questions

**Q: Is this legal?**  
A: Yes! This is an authorized security research project with full AWS and institutional approval.

**Q: Are we harming attackers?**  
A: No. We're only providing humorous responses and wasting their time - which is already their attempt on our system.

**Q: Can the troll engine be detected?**  
A: Very unlikely. Responses appear as normal system output using authentic-looking shell behaviors.

**Q: How much does this cost?**  
A: ~$15/month EC2 instance + minimal CloudWatch logs. ROI is massive in defensive value.

**Q: Can I add a new troll persona?**  
A: Yes! Edit `deploy-ultimate-troll.sh` and add new persona logic to the prompt templates.

**Q: What if a real user connects?**  
A: IP whitelist (in `Filtering` layer) prevents team members from seeing troll responses.
