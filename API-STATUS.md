# üîå API Integration Status

## ‚úÖ Currently Active APIs

### 1. **GreyNoise Research API** 
**Status:** ‚úÖ ACTIVE  
**Key:** `t6UcPKF1RR1hn6eRuOsqc7X5FU8uM6ldUdcRUWA6uldMgsTysCQnWhmk2SIZN3C1`  
**Integration:** Enhanced Discord Monitor  
**Features:**
- Real-time IP reputation checking
- Known scanner detection
- Benign service identification
- Classification (malicious/benign/unknown)
- Last seen timestamps
- Service name identification

**Usage:** Every attacker IP is automatically checked against GreyNoise and enriched data is sent to Discord alerts.

---

### 2. **Discord Webhook API**
**Status:** ‚úÖ ACTIVE  
**Integration:** Enhanced Discord Monitor  
**Features:**
- Real-time attack alerts
- Verbose threat intelligence
- Command execution notifications
- File upload/download alerts

## üöÄ Ready to Deploy

### 3. **Shodan API** (NEW!)
**Status:** ‚è≥ READY TO DEPLOY  
**Key:** *Need to add your Shodan API key*  
**Integration:** Daily Heatmap Generator  
**Features:**
- Geolocation of attacker IPs
- Daily heatmap generation at midnight UTC
- Top countries/cities statistics
- Organization identification
- Automatic Discord posting

**Deployment:**
```bash
# Set your Shodan API key
export SHODAN_API_KEY='your_shodan_key_here'

# Deploy
cd /home/ec2-user/AWSHoneypot/02-Deployment-Scripts
chmod +x deploy-shodan-heatmap.sh
./deploy-shodan-heatmap.sh
```

**Output:**
- Daily heatmaps saved to `/tmp/attacker_heatmap_YYYYMMDD.html`
- Statistics posted to Discord at midnight UTC
- Logs in `/opt/cowrie/var/log/heatmap.log`

## ‚ùå Not Currently Active

### 4. **VirusTotal API**
**Status:** ‚ùå NOT ACTIVE  
**Reason:** Redundant with GreyNoise Research API  
**Note:** GreyNoise provides better real-time threat intelligence for IP reputation. VirusTotal is more useful for file hash analysis, which we can add if needed for malware samples.

**Potential Use Case:** Analyze uploaded malware files from `/opt/cowrie/var/downloads/`

---

### 5. **AbuseIPDB API**
**Status:** ‚ùå NOT ACTIVE  
**Reason:** Not yet integrated  
**Potential Use Case:** Additional IP reputation data, abuse reports

---

### 6. **AWS Bedrock (Claude AI)**
**Status:** ‚ùå NOT ACTIVE  
**Reason:** IAM permissions not configured  
**Current Workaround:** AI Troll Agents use fallback responses (working perfectly!)  
**Note:** Can enable for dynamic AI-generated troll responses if desired

## üìä API Usage Summary

| API | Status | Purpose | Cost |
|-----|--------|---------|------|
| GreyNoise Research | ‚úÖ Active | IP threat intel | Free tier |
| Discord Webhook | ‚úÖ Active | Real-time alerts | Free |
| Shodan | ‚è≥ Ready | Geolocation heatmaps | Paid ($59/mo or free tier) |
| VirusTotal | ‚ùå Inactive | File analysis | Not needed |
| AWS Bedrock | ‚ùå Inactive | Dynamic AI responses | Optional |

---

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Deploy Shodan Heatmaps** - Add your Shodan API key and deploy for daily geolocation visualization
2. **Keep GreyNoise** - It's providing excellent real-time threat intelligence
3. **Skip VirusTotal** - Redundant with GreyNoise for IP analysis
4. **Optional: Enable Bedrock** - Only if you want dynamic AI-generated troll responses instead of fallbacks

## üîë API Key Management

**Current Keys:**
- ‚úÖ GreyNoise: Configured in `enhanced_discord_monitor.py`
- ‚úÖ Discord Webhook: Configured in `discord_config.json`
- ‚è≥ Shodan: Need to add (see deployment instructions above)

**Security:**
- All API keys excluded from git via `.gitignore`
- Keys stored in environment variables or config files
- Never commit keys to repository
