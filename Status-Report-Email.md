- **Current Status**: Fully operational with active threat collection

## üèóÔ∏è **Infrastructure Deployment Completed**

### **AWS Cloud Architecture**
- **EC2 Instance**: `i-04d996c187504b547` (t3.micro, Ubuntu 22.04)
- **Elastic IP**: `44.218.220.47` (permanent public IP for consistent targeting)
- **VPC Configuration**: Isolated security groups with controlled access
- **CloudFormation IaC**: Complete infrastructure-as-code deployment templates
- **SSH Access**: Secure team access on port 22, honeypot service on port 2222

### **Security Implementation**
- **Cowrie Honeypot**: v2.5.0 SSH/Telnet emulation honeypot
- **Realistic Filesystem**: Believable fake directory structure with decoy files
- **Session Recording**: Complete attacker interaction logging and command capture
- **Network Isolation**: Honeypot completely isolated from production systems

## üîç **Advanced Threat Intelligence Integration**

### **5-API Enrichment Pipeline**
Successfully implemented automated threat intelligence enrichment using:
- **AbuseIPDB**: IP reputation and abuse confidence scoring (0-100%)
- **VirusTotal**: Malware detection across 70+ security engines
- **AlienVault OTX**: Open threat exchange indicators and pulse data
- **Shodan**: Internet scan data, open ports, and CVE identification
- **GreyNoise**: Mass scanner vs targeted attack classification

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **48-hour TTL cache**: Reduces API calls by 90%+ for repeat attackers
- **3-second timeouts**: Non-blocking enrichment with graceful error handling
- **Rate limit compliance**: Operates within free tier API limits
- **Automated caching**: Intelligent cache management with automatic cleanup

## üìä **Real-Time Monitoring & Alerting**

### **Discord Integration**
- **Real-time alerts**: Immediate notifications for all honeypot activity
- **Enriched notifications**: Each alert includes full threat intelligence context
- **Team coordination**: 24/7 monitoring rotation with shared alert visibility
- **Formatted reporting**: Professional threat intel summaries for each incident

### **Automated Analysis**
- **Command classification**: Automatic detection of suspicious vs normal commands
- **File download tracking**: Malware sample collection and analysis
- **Session correlation**: Linking related attack sessions and campaigns
- **Geographic tracking**: Real-time attacker location and ISP identification

## üö® **Active Threat Collection Results**

### **Recent Malware Captures** (Sample from today)
- **Botnet Recruitment**: Captured multi-stage malware deployment chains
- **C2 Infrastructure**: Identified command & control servers (`8.217.21.175`, `47.86.5.176`)
- **UPX-packed Executables**: Collected packed malware binaries for analysis
- **Base64 Payloads**: Intercepted encrypted command sequences and configurations

### **Attack Pattern Analysis**
- **Automated vs Manual**: Distinguishing between bot activity and human attackers
- **Credential Stuffing**: Common passwords (`123456`, `admin`, `root`)
- **Human Indicators**: Emotional passwords like "FUCKYOU" indicating frustrated manual attackers
- **Geographic Distribution**: Attacks primarily from Asia-Pacific regions
