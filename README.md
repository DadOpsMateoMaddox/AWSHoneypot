**George Mason University - AIT670 Cloud Computing - Fall 2025**

## Project Overview

CerberusMesh is an enterprise-grade deception framework implementing a Cowrie SSH honeypot with advanced threat intelligence capabilities. Deployed on AWS EC2 infrastructure, this system demonstrates production-level cloud security implementation, real-time threat analysis, and automated attack attribution.

### Core Capabilities

- **Advanced Threat Intelligence**: Multi-API enrichment pipeline with GreyNoise, Shodan, and AbuseIPDB integration
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: Automated classification of attacker techniques and tactics
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Real-time fingerprinting to distinguish automated scanners from human operators
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Daily heatmap generation showing global attacker distribution
- **Lambda Enrichment Pipeline**: Decoupled, fault-tolerant threat intelligence processing

### Technical Stack

- **Platform**: AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux 2) - us-east-1a
- **Honeypot**: Cowrie v2.5.0 SSH/Telnet emulation
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform/CloudFormation IaC
- **Enrichment**: AWS Lambda + SNS + S3
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced Discord webhooks with verbose threat intelligence
- **APIs**: GreyNoise Research, Shodan, AbuseIPDB (optional)

## Architecture

### Infrastructure Components

**EC2 Instance**
- Instance ID: i-04d996c187504b547
- Elastic IP: 44.218.220.47
- Ports: 22 (admin), 2222 (honeypot)
- VPC: 10.0.0.0/16 isolated network

**Threat Intelligence Pipeline**
```
Cowrie Logs → Telemetry Enrichment → Behavioral Analytics → 
MITRE Mapping → Lambda Enrichment → Discord Alerts + S3 Archive
```

**Daily Automation**

- 60-day historical attacker geolocation
- Automated Discord reporting

### Security Features

**Honey Credentials**
- Fake AWS credentials in filesystem
- CloudTrail monitoring for usage attempts
- Instant attacker attribution

**Behavioral Fingerprinting**
- Latency analysis (automated vs human)
- TTY size tracking
- Command timing patterns

**MITRE ATT&CK Classification**
- T1082: System Information Discovery
- T1053: Scheduled Task/Job
- T1560: Archive Collected Data
- T1021: Remote Services
- T1059: Command Interpreter

## Advanced Features

### Lambda Enrichment Pipeline

Decoupled threat intelligence processing:
- SNS topic for event streaming
- Lambda function for API enrichment
- S3 immutable log archival
- Fault-tolerant design

**Benefits**
- API outages don't block alerts
- Async processing with retry logic
- Cost: ~$1/month for 1M events

### Behavioral Analytics

Automated attacker classification:
- Reconnaissance phase detection
- Persistence attempt identification
- Data exfiltration tracking
- Lateral movement monitoring

### Honey Credentials

Attribution traps:
- Fake AWS credentials
- Fake SSH keys
- Fake database credentials
- CloudTrail monitoring

## Security & Ethics

### Security Protocols

- Credential management via .gitignore
- Least-privilege IAM policies
- Network isolation (VPC)
- Key-based authentication only
- Immutable S3 logging

### Ethical Guidelines
