## Real-World Behavior

### What Happens When Attacker Connects

1. **Attacker SSH connects** to port 2222
2. **Session starts** with normal honeypot interaction
3. **Attacker executes commands** (whoami, ls, etc.)
4. **Troll Agent activates** and selects a persona
5. **Comedy response generated** based on attacker input
6. **Response appears in shell** - looks like real system output
7. **Attacker puzzled** - behavior doesn't match expected
8. **Engagement deepens** - hooks keep them interested
9. **Time accumulates** - minutes wasted instead of real attacks
10. **Metrics sent to Discord** - team sees engagement stats

### Example Engagement

```text
$ whoami
root

$ ls
[Troll Response Activated - Philosophy Bot]
But who *are* you, really? Your query reveals the
fundamental uncertainty of identity. Are you not merely
bits in a digital consciousness? Consider: does the
philosopher truly find truth, or does truth find the
philosopher? 🤔

$ id
But what *is* an id? An arbitrary numerical designation?
Or something more profound...
```

## Team Monitoring

### What Team Sees in Discord

- ✅ **Real-time troll engagement alerts**
- ✅ **Persona selected for each attacker**
- ✅ **Time wasted per attack session**
- ✅ **Engagement depth metrics**
- ✅ **Comparison: Traditional honeypot vs Troll-Enhanced**

### Discord Channel Updates

Every 5-10 minutes of active engagement:

```text
🎯 New Attacker from 203.x.x.x
😈 TROLLING ENGAGED - Philosophy Bot
⏱️ Time Wasted: 12 minutes
📊 Engagement: 18 responses (100% rate)
🎣 Hook: Deep existential questions
📈 Escalation: Medium → High
```
