# üéâ Issue Resolved: Honeypot Alerts Fixed

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY RESOLVED**  
**Duration**: ~30 minutes  

---

## üî¥ Original Problem

**User Report**: "check on the honeypot, it stopped sending out alerts"

**Symptoms**:
- Discord alerts not appearing
- Honeypot appeared to be offline
- No attack notifications reaching team

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Duplicate `[honeypot]` Section in Configuration

**Discovery**: Cowrie configuration file `/opt/cowrie/etc/cowrie.cfg` had a **duplicate `[honeypot]` section** at line 1064, causing a `ConfigParser.DuplicateSectionError`.

**Impact**:
- Cowrie honeypot couldn't start
- Discord monitor had no events to report
- Service had been down for unknown period

**Error message**:
```
configparser.DuplicateSectionError: While reading from '/opt/cowrie/etc/cowrie.cfg' 
[line 1064]: section 'honeypot' already exists
```

### Secondary Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Discord Monitor Permissions**
   - Service running as `ec2-user` 
   - Files owned by `cowrie` user
   - Result: Permission denied writing to log file

2. **No Service Persistence**
   - Cowrie running manually (not as systemd service)
   - Would not survive reboot or logout
   - Required manual restart after crashes

3. **IP Address Confusion**
   - Repository had wrong EC2 IP addresses
   - Documentation pointed to terminated duplicate instance
   - Fixed: Reverted to correct us-east-1 instance

---

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Cowrie Configuration ‚úÖ
**Action**: Removed duplicate `[honeypot]` section from line 1064 onwards
```bash
sudo sed -i "1064,\$d" /opt/cowrie/etc/cowrie.cfg
```
**Result**: Configuration file reduced from 1071 to 1063 lines, duplicate sections removed

### 2. Fixed Discord Monitor Permissions ‚úÖ
**Action**: Changed ownership to match service user
```bash
sudo chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user /opt/cowrie/discord-monitor
```
**Result**: Discord monitor can now write logs and send alerts

### 3. Created Cowrie Systemd Service ‚úÖ
**Action**: Created `/etc/systemd/system/cowrie.service`
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Cowrie SSH Honeypot
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=cowrie
Group=cowrie
WorkingDirectory=/opt/cowrie
ExecStart=/opt/cowrie/bin/cowrie start
ExecStop=/opt/cowrie/bin/cowrie stop
PIDFile=/opt/cowrie/var/run/cowrie.pid
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
**Commands executed**:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable cowrie
sudo systemctl start cowrie
```

### 4. Verified Services Persist ‚úÖ
**Services enabled for boot**:
- ‚úÖ `cowrie.service` - enabled
- ‚úÖ `cowrie-discord-monitor.service` - enabled

**Port verification**:
```
tcp  0.0.0.0:2222  0.0.0.0:*  LISTEN  26672/python3.8 (Cowrie)
```

### 5. Fixed Repository IP Addresses ‚úÖ
**Changed**: All references from `3.140.96.146` (us-east-2) ‚Üí `44.218.220.47` (us-east-1)

**Files updated**: 20+ files including:
- `.bashrc_ubuntu`, `.bashrc_honeypot_additions`
- `README.md`, tutorials, deployment scripts
- Documentation guides

## üß™ Testing Performed

### 1. SSH Connection Test ‚úÖ
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/gmu-honeypot-key.pem ec2-user@44.218.220.47
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ Connected successfully to us-east-1 instance

### 2. Cowrie Service Test ‚úÖ
```bash
sudo systemctl status cowrie
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ Active (running), listening on port 2222

### 3. Discord Monitor Test ‚úÖ
```bash
sudo systemctl status cowrie-discord-monitor
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ Active (running), monitoring Cowrie logs

### 4. End-to-End Alert Test ‚úÖ
**Action**: Connected to honeypot on port 2222
**Result**: ‚úÖ **Discord alert received!** (User confirmed: "just got the alert")

### 5. Persistence Test ‚úÖ
**Verified**: Both services enabled for boot
**Result**: ‚úÖ Will survive logout, reboot, and crashes (auto-restart configured)

## üìù Lessons Learned

### Configuration Management
‚ö†Ô∏è **Duplicate configuration sections cause silent failures**
- Always validate config syntax before deployment
- Use version control for configuration files
- Backup before making changes

### Service Management
‚ö†Ô∏è **Manual service starts don't persist**
- Always use systemd for production services
- Enable services to start on boot
- Configure auto-restart for resilience

### Permissions
‚ö†Ô∏è **Service user must match file ownership**
- Systemd `User=` directive must align with file permissions
- Check ownership when troubleshooting permission errors

### Infrastructure
‚ö†Ô∏è **Use Elastic IPs for persistent services**
- Public IPs change on reboot without EIPs
- Always verify which instance has actual data
- Check for duplicates in multi-region deployments
